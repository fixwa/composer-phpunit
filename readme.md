# A basic project for basic unit testing.

This project contains an empty class with a simple Unit Test that can be used to make bigger things.

The point of this is to have a complete setup of phpunit.xml configuration file and composer dependencies.

## To play

> git clone <this-repo>
> cd  composer-phpunit
> php composer.phar install
> ./vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration tests/phpunit.xml
